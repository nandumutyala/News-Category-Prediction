McLeod told Guardian Australia that he believed as many as 5,000 fish may have died in the incident. However the vast majority were believed to be European carp, an invasive species, rather than the endangered native Murray cod. In a statement, the NSW Department of Primary Industries said the aerial footage was consistent with satellite images that showed the lake was ""almost completely dry"". It said fish kills in the Menindee lakes were usually dominated by the carp as they lacked the evolutionary response of native species to seek deep channels in dry conditions. Thousands of fish died in the Darling River system around Menindee earlier in the year, drawing outrage from locals who blamed mismanagement of the waterway. Credit: Rory McLeod via Storyful",weather
